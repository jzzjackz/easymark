# SYNTAX GUIDE

For size changes (like small), use the prefix @

For example: @small, @header

For other text-based modifications, use the $ prefix.

For example: $mark, $url, $cb

For lists, use the - prefix at the start of a line.

For example: - List item 1

For inline bold text, use parentheses.

For example: (bold text)

For italic text, use ampersands.

For example: &italic text&

# For future reference

EasyMark will continue to recieve updates, but, here are the things that should be noted for any future notes:

Old EasyMark (v1.0.1 and older) used @ and $ prefixes for everything, now, we have prefixes
more similar to current markdown, **BUT**, the size prefixes will never change, so things like @header and @small will not get their own short prefixes, unlike markdown. this is because it is unnecessary. All else future additions will stay in the new format, though, aslong as they aren't about size.
